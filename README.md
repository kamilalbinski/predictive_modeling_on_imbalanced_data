This is an exstract of my final project for Data Sciene postgraduate programme. The main objective of this project was to demonstrate comprehensive supervised machine learning model development process, focusing on imbalanced data using default_of_credit_card_clients.csv dataset downloaded from UCI Machine Learning repository. The key steps included are Exploratory Data Analyis, Model Development and Hyperparameter optimization. Model has been evaluated based on F1 score.
